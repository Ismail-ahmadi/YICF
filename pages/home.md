## Empowering refugees & the urban poor
A bustling, megacity of almost 30 million residents, greater Jakarta is also home to over 6,000 refugees and asylum-seekers and over 7,000 waste pickers living and working on landfills. Due to social and legal barriers, both populations lack access to education, healthcare, and formal employment.

Our work emerged organically in response to these challenges and eventually obtained official NGO status in 2015. We are a vibrant network of almost 100 Indonesians, expatriates, and refugees working together to create educational and economic opportunities for marginalized communities.

Today, Light of Dawn International (in Indonesian: Yayasan Internasional Cahaya Fajar) impacts the lives of over 250 refugees and 300 Indonesian families in greater Jakarta. Our mission is to empower marginalized urban communities, especially those affected by some of the biggest humanitarian issues of the modern era: the movement of displaced peoples, urban migration, and the rising divide between the rich and the poor.
